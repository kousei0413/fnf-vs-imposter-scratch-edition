# fnf-vs-imposter-scratch-edition

acturlly This fucking project started two years ago.lol
But Damn it was only recently made public:)))　　
ahhhhhh.. With all this fucking nonsense out of the way, let's talk about this fucking project.

As you can see from the title, this project is a project to port FNF vs Imposter to Scratch.
And here we release fucking development versions, fucking older versions, fucking beta versions and fucking regular versions of it.

But even after more than damn two years, my fucking Scratch account is not well known, so no one will see my work no matter how fucking up good it is (sobs).

Damn :(((((
